# SECE Space Deployment Guide

## Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

Your frontend is already deployed at: **https://sece-space.vercel.app**

### Environment Variables for Vercel:
Set the following environment variable in your Vercel dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

Replace `https://your-backend-url.com` with your actual backend deployment URL.

## Backend Deployment

### CORS Configuration
The backend is now configured to accept requests from:
- `http://localhost:3000` (development)
- `https://sece-space.vercel.app` (production)

### Environment Variables for Backend:
Make sure your backend deployment has these environment variables:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Your Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Your Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Your Cloudinary API secret
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `PORT` - Port number (usually set automatically by hosting provider)

### Recommended Backend Hosting:
- **Railway** - Easy Node.js deployment
- **Render** - Free tier available
- **Heroku** - Popular choice
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Good performance

## After Backend Deployment:

1. **Update Vercel Environment Variable:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to your project settings
   - Add/update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` with your backend URL

2. **Test the Connection:**
   - Visit https://sece-space.vercel.app
   - Try logging in and uploading files
   - Check browser console for any CORS errors

## Backend Deployment Fixes Applied:

### 🔧 **Fixed Issues:**
✅ **Production Start Script**: Changed from `nodemon` to `node` for production
✅ **Port Binding**: Server now binds to `0.0.0.0` (required for most hosting services)
✅ **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for missing files/modules
✅ **Health Checks**: Added `/health` endpoint for deployment monitoring
✅ **Debug Logging**: Added startup logs to help diagnose deployment issues

### 📋 **Deployment Files Created:**
- `render.yaml` - Render deployment configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Docker deployment option
- `healthcheck.js` - Health check script

### 🚀 **Ready for Deployment:**
Your backend should now deploy successfully on:
- **Render** (recommended)
- **Railway** 
- **Heroku**
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
